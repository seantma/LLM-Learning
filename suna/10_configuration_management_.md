# Chapter 10: Configuration Management

Welcome to the final chapter of our `suna` backend tutorial! In the [previous chapter](09_data_providers_.md), we explored **Data Providers**, which allow the agent to fetch reliable, structured data directly from services like LinkedIn or Zillow using their official APIs. We noted that these providers often need specific API keys to work.

This brings us to a crucial question: where do all the settings for `suna` live? How does it know which database to connect to? How does it get the secret API keys for services like Anthropic, OpenAI, Stripe, or RapidAPI? How can we change these settings easily when moving from a local development computer to a live production server?

Hardcoding these values directly into the Python files would be messy and insecure. We need a proper system for managing these settings.

## What's the Problem? Where Do Settings Live?

Imagine building a complex machine like a robot. This robot needs various adjustments and settings:

*   How fast should its motors run?
*   Which Wi-Fi network should it connect to?
*   What's the password for that network?
*   What's the access code for its charging station?

You wouldn't want to solder these settings directly onto the circuit board! You'd want a central control panel or a settings file where you can easily view and change these parameters without rebuilding the robot.

Similarly, our `suna` application needs various pieces of information to run correctly:

*   **API Keys:** Secret keys to talk to [LLM Service Interface](07_llm_service_interface_.md) (like `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), [Data Providers](09_data_providers_.md) (`RAPID_API_KEY`), search tools (`TAVILY_API_KEY`), and billing (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`).
*   **Database Connection:** The URL and keys needed to connect to the Supabase database ([Data Providers](09_data_providers_.md) use this via `DBConnection`).
*   **Sandbox Settings:** Information needed to connect to the Daytona service that manages the [Sandbox Environment](03_sandbox_environment_.md).
*   **Environment Differences:** Settings might need to be different depending on whether the app is running on your local computer (development), a testing server (staging), or the live server for users (production). For example, you might use a test database locally but a real one in production.

Scattering these settings throughout the code is bad practice. It makes the application hard to configure, update, and deploy, and it's a major security risk if secret keys are accidentally committed to version control (like Git).

**Use Case:** How does the `RapidDataProviderBase` class (used by [Data Providers](09_data_providers_.md)) get the `RAPID_API_KEY` it needs to talk to RapidAPI? How does the [LLM Service Interface](07_llm_service_interface_.md) get the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`? How does the `DBConnection` know the `SUPABASE_URL`?

## Meet the "Settings Panel": Configuration Management

**Configuration Management** in `suna` is like the application's central "Settings Panel" or "Control Room". It provides a single, organized way to handle all these application settings, API keys, and environment-specific parameters.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Loading Values:** When the `suna` application starts, the Configuration Management system reads settings from specific places:
    *   **Environment Variables:** These are settings defined directly in the operating system where the application is running. This is the standard way to configure applications in staging and production environments.
    *   **`.env` Files:** For local development, it's common to store settings in a special file named `.env` in the project's root directory. This file is usually *ignored* by version control (Git) to keep secrets safe. The system can automatically load values from this file if it exists.
2.  **Central Storage:** It holds these loaded values in a central object (in `suna`, it's an instance of the `Configuration` class).
3.  **Easy Access:** Any other part of the `suna` backend (like the [LLM Service Interface](07_llm_service_interface_.md) or [Data Providers](09_data_providers_.md)) can easily import this central configuration object and access the settings they need (e.g., `config.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
4.  **Security:** By loading sensitive keys from environment variables or `.env` files (which are not checked into Git), it prevents secrets from being accidentally exposed in the codebase.
5.  **Flexibility:** It allows the same codebase to run in different environments (local, staging, production) just by changing the environment variables or the `.env` file, without modifying the Python code itself.

## How it Solves the Use Case

Let's see how our components get their required settings:

1.  **App Start:** The `suna` backend starts up.
2.  **Config Loads:** The Configuration Management system (the `Configuration` class in `backend/utils/config.py`) initializes. It reads environment variables and/or the `.env` file, loading values like `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `RAPID_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, etc., into a central `config` object.
3.  **LLM Service Needs Key:** The [LLM Service Interface](07_llm_service_interface_.md) code needs the Anthropic key. It simply imports the `config` object and accesses the value:

    ```python
    # Simplified from backend/services/llm.py
    from utils.config import config # Import the central config object

    # ... later in the code ...
    api_key = config.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    # Now 'api_key' holds the value loaded from the environment or .env
    ```

4.  **Data Provider Needs Key:** Similarly, the `RapidDataProviderBase` used by [Data Providers](09_data_providers_.md) needs the RapidAPI key:

    ```python
    # Simplified from backend/agent/tools/data_providers/RapidDataProviderBase.py
    # (os.getenv is often used directly, or config could be used)
    import os
    # OR: from utils.config import config

    # ... later in the code ...
    api_key = os.getenv("RAPID_API_KEY") # Reads directly from environment
    # OR: api_key = config.RAPID_API_KEY # Access via the config object
    ```

5.  **Database Needs URL:** The `DBConnection` class needs the Supabase URL:

    ```python
    # Simplified from backend/services/supabase.py
    from utils.config import config

    # ... inside initialize method ...
    supabase_url = config.SUPABASE_URL
    supabase_key = config.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY # Or ANON_KEY
    # These variables now hold the values loaded by the config system
    ```

The components don't need to know *where* the values came from (environment variables or `.env` file). They just ask the central `config` object for the setting they need by its name.

## Under the Hood: Loading and Accessing Configuration

The core logic resides in `backend/utils/config.py`. Let's trace the process:

1.  **Import:** When the application starts, Python imports various modules. As soon as `backend/utils/config.py` is imported, it creates a single instance of the `Configuration` class, named `config`.
2.  **Initialization (`Configuration.__init__`)**:
    *   **Load `.env`:** It uses the `dotenv` library (`load_dotenv()`) to automatically look for a `.env` file in the project directory and load any variables defined there into the environment *for the current run*. This is especially useful for local development.
    *   **Determine Mode:** It reads the `ENV_MODE` environment variable (defaulting to "local") to know if it's running in `local`, `staging`, or `production`. This can affect which settings (like Stripe IDs) are used.
    *   **Load from Environment (`_load_from_env`)**: It iterates through all the expected configuration variables defined in the `Configuration` class (using Python's type hints). For each variable, it uses `os.getenv(VARIABLE_NAME)` to read the corresponding value from the environment variables (which might have been set by the system or loaded from the `.env` file).
    *   **Type Conversion:** It converts the loaded string values into the expected types (e.g., string, integer, boolean).
    *   **Store Value:** It stores the loaded (and typed) value as an attribute of the `config` object (e.g., `self.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = loaded_value`).
    *   **Validation (`_validate`)**: It checks if all *required* settings (those not marked as optional) have been loaded. If any are missing, it raises an error to prevent the application from starting with incomplete configuration.
3.  **Access:** Later, when another part of the code (like `llm.py`) needs a setting, it simply imports the already-initialized `config` object from `utils.config` and accesses the attribute directly (e.g., `config.RAPID_API_KEY`).

Here's a simple diagram illustrating the loading process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AppStart as Application Start
    participant ConfigPy as config.py / Configuration Class
    participant DotEnv as .env File
    participant EnvVars as Environment Variables
    participant OtherCode as Other Module (e.g., llm.py)

    AppStart->>+ConfigPy: Import config.py
    ConfigPy->>ConfigPy: Initialize Configuration() instance
    ConfigPy->>DotEnv: load_dotenv() (Reads .env file)
    Note over DotEnv, EnvVars: .env values loaded into EnvVars for this run
    ConfigPy->>EnvVars: os.getenv("VAR_NAME") for each setting
    EnvVars-->>ConfigPy: Return value (or None)
    ConfigPy->>ConfigPy: Store values, convert types, validate
    ConfigPy-->>-AppStart: config object is ready
    AppStart->>+OtherCode: Import other modules
    OtherCode->>ConfigPy: from utils.config import config
    OtherCode->>ConfigPy: Access config.VAR_NAME
    ConfigPy-->>-OtherCode: Return stored value
```

## Peeking at the Code

Let's look at simplified snippets from `backend/utils/config.py`.

**1. Defining Settings with Type Hints**

The `Configuration` class defines the expected settings and their types.

```python
# Simplified from backend/utils/config.py
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

class EnvMode(Enum):
    LOCAL = "local"
    STAGING = "staging"
    PRODUCTION = "production"

class Configuration:
    # Define expected settings with type hints
    ENV_MODE: EnvMode = EnvMode.LOCAL

    # API Keys (some required, some optional)
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: str # Required
    OPENAI_API_KEY: Optional[str] = None # Optional
    RAPID_API_KEY: str # Required

    # Supabase
    SUPABASE_URL: str
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: str

    # Daytona
    DAYTONA_API_KEY: str
    DAYTONA_SERVER_URL: str
    # ... other settings defined ...
```

*   This structure clearly shows what settings the application expects.
*   Using `str` means the setting is required. Using `Optional[str]` means it's okay if the environment variable isn't set.

**2. Initialization and Loading**

The `__init__` method orchestrates the loading process.

```python
# Simplified from backend/utils/config.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from typing import get_type_hints

class Configuration:
    # ... (settings definitions) ...

    def __init__(self):
        # Load .env file first (if it exists)
        load_dotenv()

        # Determine environment mode
        env_mode_str = os.getenv("ENV_MODE", EnvMode.LOCAL.value)
        try:
            self.ENV_MODE = EnvMode(env_mode_str.lower())
        except ValueError:
            self.ENV_MODE = EnvMode.LOCAL

        # Load values from environment variables
        self._load_from_env()

        # Validate required fields are present
        self._validate()

    def _load_from_env(self):
        # Iterate through expected settings defined by type hints
        for key, expected_type in get_type_hints(self.__class__).items():
            # Skip internal fields or properties
            if key.startswith('_') or isinstance(getattr(self, key, None), property):
                 continue

            # Read from environment variable
            env_val = os.getenv(key)

            if env_val is not None:
                # Basic type conversion (more types handled in actual code)
                if expected_type == bool:
                    value = env_val.lower() in ('true', 't', '1')
                elif expected_type == int:
                    value = int(env_val)
                else: # Handles str, Optional[str], Enum etc.
                    value = env_val
                # Store the value as an attribute
                setattr(self, key, value)

    def _validate(self):
        # Simplified validation: Check if required fields (type hint != Optional) are set
        missing_fields = []
        for field, field_type in get_type_hints(self.__class__).items():
             # Skip internal fields or properties
             if field.startswith('_') or isinstance(getattr(self, field, None), property):
                  continue
             # Check if it's optional (more robust check needed for Union types)
             is_optional = "Optional" in str(field_type)
             if not is_optional and getattr(self, field, None) is None:
                 missing_fields.append(field)

        if missing_fields:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required config: {', '.join(missing_fields)}")
```

*   `load_dotenv()`: Attempts to load variables from a `.env` file.
*   `_load_from_env()`: Uses `os.getenv(key)` to read each variable.
*   `setattr(self, key, value)`: Stores the loaded value in the `config` object.
*   `_validate()`: Checks that all non-optional settings were actually loaded.

**3. Example `.env` File**

For local development, you might create a `.env` file like this ( **DO NOT commit this file to Git** ):

```dotenv
# .env file (Example - DO NOT COMMIT ACTUAL KEYS)

# LLM Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Data Providers
RAPID_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.xxxxx.xxxxx

# Daytona
DAYTONA_API_KEY=dt_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DAYTONA_SERVER_URL=https://your-daytona-instance.com
DAYTONA_TARGET=your-target-name

# Stripe (Optional for local dev)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Set environment mode
ENV_MODE=local
```

When you run the `suna` backend locally, `load_dotenv()` will read this file, and the `Configuration` class will load these values. In production, these values would typically be set directly as environment variables on the server.

**4. Accessing Configuration**

Other modules import and use the `config` object:

```python
# Example in backend/services/llm.py
from utils.config import config # Import the singleton instance
from utils.logger import logger

def setup_api_keys():
    if config.OPENAI_API_KEY:
        logger.debug("OpenAI API Key found.")
    if config.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:
        logger.debug("Anthropic API Key found.")
    # ... and so on ...

# Call setup when the module is loaded
setup_api_keys()
```

## Conclusion

Configuration Management is the backbone of a well-structured and secure application like `suna`. By using a centralized `Configuration` class (`backend/utils/config.py`), `suna` cleanly separates settings (like API keys and database URLs) from the core application logic.

It loads these settings from environment variables or `.env` files, making it easy to switch between development, staging, and production environments without code changes. This approach enhances security by keeping sensitive keys out of the main codebase and provides a single, reliable place for all components to access the configuration they need.

This concludes our tour through the core components of the `suna` backend! We hope this journey, from the [API Layer (FastAPI)](01_api_layer__fastapi__.md) handling requests, through the agent's core ([Agent Core & Prompt](02_agent_core___prompt_.md)), its workspace ([Sandbox Environment](03_sandbox_environment_.md)), its abilities ([Agent Tools](04_agent_tools_.md)), its execution management ([ThreadManager (AgentPress)](05_threadmanager__agentpress__.md), [Agent Execution Loop](06_agent_execution_loop_.md), [ContextManager (AgentPress)](08_contextmanager__agentpress__.md)), its communication channels ([LLM Service Interface](07_llm_service_interface_.md), [Data Providers](09_data_providers_.md)), and finally its settings ([Configuration Management](10_configuration_management_.md)), has given you a clear understanding of how `suna` operates. Happy coding!
